Assignment 15.2: Asset Store

Asset = Free SF Fighter
Chose asset as it’s the most detailed of the spaceships available for free on the asset store’s 3D section. 
Hoping to use the asset as my primary spacecraft in my capstone project. 
It’s useful because it’s free and is also similar to the aesthetic that I’m hoping to have.
This asset prevents me from having to spend time designing my own artwork, which would take hours as I’m not an artist by trade or skill. 
This asset is free, however, I would still pay money for it, as it will be the primary player’s spacecraft. Since the game is a horizontal sci-fi shooter, it’s what the player will be using during the entire duration of the game. 

Asset = Oxar Light Freighter
The asset was free and was a higher quality asset of a large spaceship.
Asset will be used to represent the Boss enemy for the 1st level of my capstone project. 
This asset is useful because it allows me to have a distinct asset for the boss of my first level.
As will all art-based assets, this will allow me to save time in the art stage of development. 
This asset is free.

Asset = Shoot´em up Enemy Spikeball
This asset seemed like a great option to be used for a ‘bomb’ weapon. 
The player’s ship will have 2 weapons, a ‘laser’ and a ‘bomb’. This asset will act as the image for the ‘bomb’.
It’s useful because it looks like a bomb.
It speeds up development because now I don’t have to draw a bomb.
This asset was free – however I would probably pay for an asset that has this much presence in the game. 

Asset = Space Droid
I chose this asset because it looks like an enemy ship.
This asset will be used for the smaller enemies that the player will have to fight, on their way to the boss battle. 
The asset is useful because it looks like a small enemy spacecraft.
Purchasing this asset keeps me from having to make ethe art myself, saving hours in development.
This asset was free. However, I would probably pay money for an asset that has this much presence in the game.
